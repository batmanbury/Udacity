"""
In this problem set you work with cities infobox data, audit it, come up with a
cleaning idea and then clean it up.

If you look at the full city data, you will notice that there are a couple of
values that seem to provide the same information in different formats: "point"
seems to be the combination of "wgs84_pos#lat" and "wgs84_pos#long".

However we do not know if that is the case and should check if they are
equivalent.

Finish the function check_loc(). It will recieve 3 strings, first will be the
combined value of "point" and then the "wgs84_pos#" values separately. You have
to extract the lat and long values from the "point" and compare to the
"wgs84_pos# values and return True or False.

Note that you do not have to fix the values, just determine if they are
consistent. To fix them in this case you would need more information. Feel free
to discuss possible strategies for fixing this on the discussion forum.

The rest of the code is just an example on how this function can be used.
Changes to "process_file" function will not be take into account.
