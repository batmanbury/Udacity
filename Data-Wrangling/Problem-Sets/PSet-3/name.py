In this problem set you work with cities infobox data, audit it, come up with a
cleaning idea and then clean it up.

In the previous quiz you recognized that the "name" value can be an array (or list
in Python terms).

It would make it easier to process and query the data later, if all values for the
name would be in a Python list, instead of being just a string separated with special
characters, like now.

Finish the function fix_name(). It will recieve a string as an input, and it has to
return a list of all the names. If there is only one name, the list will have only
one item in it, if the name is "NULL", the list should be empty.

The rest of the code is just an example on how this function can be used
